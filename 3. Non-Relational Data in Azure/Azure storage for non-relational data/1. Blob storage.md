# Azure Storage for non-relational data

## Azure Blob Storage
A service that allows you to store massive amounts of unstructured data as binary large objects, known as blobs, in the cloud. 

They're an efficient way to store data files in a format that is optimised for cloud-based storage, and apps can read and write them by using the Azure blob storage API. 

In an Azure storage account, you store blobs in _containers_. Containers provide a convenient way of grouping related blobs together. You control who can read and write blobs inside a container at the container level.

Within a container, you can organize blobs in a hierarchy of virtual folders. By default, these folders are simply a way of using a "/" character in a blob name to organize the blobs into namespaces. The folders are purely virtual, and you can't perform folder-level operations to control access or perform bulk operations.

Azure Blob storage supports 3 different types of blob:
* **Block blobs**
    * Handled as a set of blocks
    * Each block can vary in size, up to 4000 MiB
    * A block blob can contain up to 190.7 TiB (4000 MiB x 50,000 blocks)
    * The block is the smallest amount of data that can be read or written as an individual unit
    * Best used to store discrete, large, binary objects that change infrequently
* **Page blobs**
    * Organised as a collection of fixed size 512-byte pages
    * Optimised to support random read and write operations, you can fetch and store data for a single page if necessary
    * Can hold up to 8TB of data
    * Azure uses page blobs to implement virtual disk storage for VMs
* **Append blobs**
    * A block blob that's optimised to support append operations
    * Can only add blocks to the end of an append blob
    * Updating or deleting existing blocks isn't supported
    * Each block can vary in size, up to 4MB
    * The max size of an append blob in just over 195 GB

### Blob Storage Access Tiers
There are three access tiers that help balance access latency and storage costs
* **Hot tier**
    * The default tier
    * Used for blobs that are accessed frequently
    * Blob data is stored on high-performance media
    * Can migrate to cool tier when the blobs are not accessed as frequently
    * Typical latency of a few millisceonds

* **Cool tier**
    * Lower performance
    * Reduced storage charges compared to hot tier
    * Used for data that is accessed infrequently
    * Can move blobs from Hot to Cool tiers if used less frequently
    * Can also move blobs from Cool to Hot tier
    * Typical latency of a few millisceonds

* **Archive tier**
    * Lowest storage cost, but increased latency
    * Used for historical data that musn't be lost, but required only rarely
    * Stored in an offline state
    * Typical latency of hours
    * Retrieving a blob from this tier back to Hot or Cool is call _rehydration_ and only when this is completed can you read the blob

You can create lifecycle management policies for blobs in a storage account. A lifecycle management policy can automatically move a blob from Hot to Cool, and then to the Archive tier, as it ages and is used less frequently (policy is based on the number of days since modification). A lifecycle management policy can also arrange to delete outdated blobs.
