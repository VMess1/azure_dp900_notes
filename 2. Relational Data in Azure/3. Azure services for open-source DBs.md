# Azure service for open-source databases

## Overview of MySQL, MariaDB & PostgreSQL
All are examples of RDBMS which are each tailored for different specialisations

### MySQL
The leading open source relational database for Linux, Apache, MySQL & PHP (LAMP) stack apps.

Available in several editions
* Community
    * Free
    * Historically popular for web apps running under linux
    * There are Windows versions available
* Standard
    * Higher performance
    * Uses different technology for storing data
* Enterprise
    * Comprehensive set of tools and features
    * Enhanced security, availability and scalability

### MariaDB
A newer RDBMS created by the developers of MySQL. The database engine has been rewritten and optimised to improve performance.
Features:
* Compatibility with Oracle DB (another popular DBMS)
* Built-in support for temporal data
* A table can hold several versions of data enabling querying the data as it appeared at some point in the past

### PostgreSQL
A hybrid relational-object database. 

Key features: 
* You can store data in relational tables, but also store custom data types with their own non-relational properties
* It is extensible, meaning you can add code modules to the DB, which can be run by queries
* Has ability to store and manipulate geometric data, such as lines, circles, and polygons


## Azure Database for MySQL
* A PaaS implenmentation of MySQL in the Azure cloud, based on the MySQL Community Edition
* High availability at no additional cost and scalability as required
* The server provides connection security
    * Enforces firewall rules
    * Optionally can require SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connections
* Many server parameters allows settings to be configured such as lock modes, max number of connections and timeouts
* Global DB system that scales up to large DBs without need to manage hardware, network components, virtual servers, software patches, and other underlying components
* Certain operations aren't available which are primarily concerned with security and administration

Benefits include:
* High availability features built-in
* Predictable performance
* Easy scaling that responds quickly to demand
* Secure data, both at rest & in motion
* Automatic back-ups and point-in-time restore for the last 35 days
* Enterprise-level security & compliance with legislation
* Pay-as-you-go pricing
* Monitoring functionality to add alerts, and to view metrics and logs

## Azure Database for MariaDB
An implementation of the MariaDB DBMS adapted to run in Azure and based on the Community Edition.

The DB is fully managed and controlled by Azure. Once you've provisioned the service and transferred your data, the system requires almost no additional administration.

Benefits include:
* Built-in high availability with no additional cost
* Predictable performance, using inclusive pay-as-you-go pricing
* Scaling as needed within seconds
* Secured protection of sensitive data at rest and in motion
* Automatic backups and point-in-time restore for up to 35 days
* Enterprise-grade security and compliance

## Azure Database for PostgreSQL
A PaaS implementation of PostgreSQL in the Azure Cloud. The service provides the same availabilility, performance scaling, security and administrative benefits as the MySQL service

Some features of on-premises PostgreSQL DBs aren't available in Azure. These features are mostly concerned with the extensions that users can add to a DB to perform specialised tasks, such as writing stored procedures in various programming languages (other than pgsql, which is available), and interacting directly with the operating system

Benefits:
* Highly available service
* Built-in failure detection and failover mechanisms
* Can continue to use pgAdmin tool but some server-focused functionality such as performing server backup and restore aren't available because the server is managed & maintained by Microsoft
* Azure records info about queries run against DBs on the server and saves them in a DB called azure_sys. You can use this to monitor the queries that users are running
