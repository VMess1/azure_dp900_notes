# Azure SQL services & capabilities
Azure SQL is a collective for a family of Microsoft SQL Server based DB services in Azure. Specific services are detailed below

## SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
- IaaS solution
- 99.99% availability
- A VM running in Azure with an installation of SQL Server instance
- Each instance can support multiple DBs
- You manage all aspects of the server including OS, SQL Server updates, config, backups and other maintenance tasks
- Fully compatible with on-premises physical and virtualised installation
- You can scale up the platform where the SQL Server is running adding more memory, CPU power and disk space as needed
- Best option for "lift and shift" migration of existing on-premises SQL Server installations to the cloud where you require access to OS features that are unsupported at a PaaS level
- You can create rapid development and test scenarios when you don't want to buy on-premises hardware

## Azure SQL Managed Instance
- PaaS solution
- 99.99% availability
- Runs a fully controllable instance of SQL Server in the cloud
- Each managed instance can support multiple DBs
- Additionally _instance pools_ can be used to share resources efficiently across smaller instances
- Managed instances depend on other Azure services including:
    - Azure Storage for backups
    - Azure Event Hubs for telemetry
    - Microsoft Entra ID for authentication
    - Azure Key Vault for Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
    - A couple of Azure platform services that provide security and supportability features
- Near-100% compatibility with SQL Server
- Most on-premises DBs can be migrated with **Azure Database Migration service**
- Fully automated updates, backups and recovery
- Provides features that are not available in Azure SQL DB
- If you use linked servers, Service Broker (a messaging system) or DB Mail, then you should use this option
- Can install **Data Migration Assistant (DMA)** to check compatability with on-premises system
- Supports logins with Microsoft Entra ID
- Use Cases:
    - If you use linked servers, Service Broker (a messaging system) or DB Mail, then you should use managed instance.
    - Best for most cloud migration scenarios when you need minimal changes to existing applications & don't need to manage OS 

## Azure SQL Database
- PaaS solution
- 99.995% availability
- You can provision a _single database_ in a dedicated, managed (logical) server; or you can use an _elastic pool_ to share resources across multiple DBs & take advantage of on-demand scalability
- Supports most core DB-level capabilities of SQL Server
- Some features depended on by an on-premises application may not be available
- Automatic updates and patches to the software, always running the latest and most secure version
- Easy scalability features without performing a costly manual upgrade
- Advanced threat protection:
    * Vulnerability assessment to help detect and remediate potential security problems
    * Detest anomalous activites that indicate unusual access attempts
    * Continuously monitored for suspicious activities and immediate security alerts
    * Monitors potential vulnerabilities, SQL injection attacks, anomalous DB access patterns
    * Provides details and recommended actions
-  Provides encryption that protects stored data and whilst being transferred
- Single Database
    * Enables quick set-up of a database server and Microsoft manages the server
    * All you do is configure the DB, create tables & populate with data
    * Can easily scale for more storage space, memory or processing power
    * Resources are pre-allocated
    * Charged per hour
    * Can specify _serverless_ configuration 
        * For this, Microsoft creates its own server, which might be shared by databases belonging to other Azure subscribers but will have ensured privacy
- Elastic Pool
    * Multiple DBS can share the same resources incl. memory, data storage space, and processing power through multiple-tenancy
    * The resources are known as a pool
    * You create the pool, only your DBs can use the pool
    * Useful if you havce DBs with resource reqs that vary over time, can help reduce costs
    * Enable syou to use the resources available in the pool, and release the resources once processing has completed (elasticity)
* Use Cases
    * Best option for low cost with minimal admin. 
    * Often used in new cloud projects
    * Modern cloud apps that need to use the latest stable SQL Server features
    * Systems with a variable load that need the DB server to scale up and down quickly
    * Apps that require high availability
