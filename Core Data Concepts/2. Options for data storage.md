# Identify options for data storage

## Describe common formats for data files

Files can be stored in:
- Local file systems on the hard disk of your computer
- Removable media such as USB devices
- Centrally in a shared file storage system
    * Typically in the cloud to enable cost-effective, secure and reliable storage

The specific file format used to store data depends on:
* The type of data being stored (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured)
* The applications and services that will need to read, write and process the data
* The need for data files to readable by humans, or optimised for effecient storage and processing

## Common file formats

#### Delimited text files
- CSV, TSV, space-delimited
- Good for structured data that need to be in a human-readable format

#### JSON 
- Hierarchical document schema to define data entities (objects) that have multiple attributes
- Each attribute might be an object or a collection of objects
- Flexible format, good for structured and semi-structured data

#### XML
- Popular in the 90s and 00s
- Largely been replaced by JSON but still used by some systems
- Uses tags to define elements and attributes

#### Binary Large Object (BLOB)
- Commonly used for images, video, audio and application specific objects


## Optimised file formats
#### Avro
- Row-based format developed within Apache Hadoop
- Uses a JSON header containing file metadata including the schema definition
- Serialises data in a compact binary format in one or more file data blocks
- Good for compressing data and minimising storage and network bandwidth requirements
- Primary use is for Apache Hadoop
- Apache Spark SQL can access Avro as a data source

#### ORC (Optimised Row Columnar)
- Data is organised into columns rather than rows
- Developed by HortonWorks for optimising read/write operations in Apache Hive.
- Contains _stripes_ of data with each stripe holding the data for a column or set of columns
- A stripe contains:
    - An index into the rows in the stripe
    - The data for each row
    - A footer that holds statistical information (count, sum, max, min and so on) for each column

#### Parquet
- Columnar data format
- Parquet files are divided into row groups, which are logical groupings of rows within the file. 
- Each row group contains one or more chunks of data
- Includes metadata that describes the set of rows found in each chunk
- Applications can quickly locate the correct chunk for a given set of rows and retrieve data in the specified columns for these rows
- Specialises in storing and processing nested data types efficiently
- Supports very efficient compression and encoding schemes


## Describe types of databases

#### Relational Databases
- Follows a strict schema
- Used to store and query structured data
- Data is normalised and uses primary and foreign keys to create the relationship between tables
- Managed and queried using SQL

#### Non-relational Databases
- DBs don't have a relational schema 
- Often referred to as NoSQL (Not Only SQL) database but some may support a variant of the SQL language
- For common types of non-relational DBs
    - Key-Value Databases: 
        - value can be in any format
    - Document Databases: 
        - a specific form of key-value DB in which the value is a JSON document
    - Column Family Databases: 
        - stores tabular data in rows and columns but you can divide the columns into groups known as column-families which are logically related together
    - Graph databases:
        - stores entities as nodes with links to define relationships between them
