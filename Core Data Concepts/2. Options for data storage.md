# Identify options for data storage

Files can be stored in:
- Local file systems on the hard disk of your computer
- Removable media such as USB devices
- Centrally in a shared file storage system
    * Typically in the cloud to enable cost-effective, secure and reliable storage


The specific file format used to store data depends on:
* The type of data being stored (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured)
* The applications and services that will need to read, write and process the data
* The need for data files to readable by humans, or optimised for effecient storage and processing

## Common file formats

#### Delimited text files
- CSV, TSV, space-delimited
- Good for structured data that need to be in a human-readable format

#### JSON 
- Hierarchical document schema to define data entities (objects) that have multiple attributes
- Each attribute might be an object or a collection of objects
- Flexible format, good for structured and semi-structured data

#### XML
- Popular in the 90s and 00s
- Largely been replaced by JSON but still used by some systems
- Uses tags to define elements and attributes

#### Binary Large Object (BLOB)
- Commonly used for images, video, audio and application specific objects
