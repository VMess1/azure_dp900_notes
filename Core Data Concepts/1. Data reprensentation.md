# Describe ways to represent data

## Structured Data 
- Fixed schema: all the data has the same fields or properties
- Tabular (rows and columns that define data attributes)
- Often stored in a DB with a relational model

## Semi-Structured Data
- Information has some structure but allows some variation between entity instances
- Doesn't follow the tabular structure
- JSON

## Unstructured Data
- No specific structure
- E.g. Documents, images, audio, video & binary files
