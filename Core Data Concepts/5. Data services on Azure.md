# An overview of Azure data services & how roles fit in
Azure has many services available to support cloud solution, including transactional and analytical data workloads.
This is an introduction of the services which are explored further in more detail in later notes

## Azure SQL
Collective name for a family of relational database solutions based on the Microsoft SQL Server database engine 
#### Azure SQL Database
- A fully managed PaaS database hosted in Azure
#### Azure SQL Managed Instance:
- A hosted instance of SQL Server with automated maintenance, which allows more flexible configuration than Azure SQL DB but with more administrative responsibility for the owner
#### Azure SQL VM
- A VM with an installation of SQL Server, allowing maximum configurability with full management responsibility

DB admins typically provision and manage Azure SQL DB systems to support line of business (LOB) applications that need to store transactional data

Data engineers may use Azure SQL DB systems as sources for data pipelines that perform extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations to ingest the transactional data into an analytical system

Data analysts may query Azure SQL DBs directly to create reports, though in large organizations the data is generally combined with data from other sources in an analytical data store to support enterprise analytics

## Azure Database for open-source relational databases
#### Azure Database for MySQL
* A simple to use open-source RDBMS that is commonly used in Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP (LAMP) stack apps
#### Azure Database for MariaDB
* A newer RDBMS created by the devs of MySQL. The DB engine has been rewritten and optimised to improve performance. MariaDB offers campatibility with Oracle DB
#### Azure Database for PostgreSQL
* A hybrid relational-object DB. You can store data in relational tables and also store custom data types with their own non-relational properties

As with Azure SQL database systems, open-source relational databases are managed by database administrators to support transactional applications, and provide a data source for data engineers building pipelines for analytical solutions and data analysts creating reports.

## Azure Cosmos DB
* A global-scale NoSQL DB system that support multiple APIs
* Enables storage and management of data as JSON  documents, key-value pairs, column-families and graphs

In some organizations, Cosmos DB instances may be provisioned and managed by a database administrator; though often software developers manage NoSQL data storage as part of the overall application architecture. 

Data engineers often need to integrate Cosmos DB data sources into enterprise analytical solutions that support modeling and reporting by data analysts.

## Azure Storage
A core Azure service that enables you to store data in different stores including:
* Blob Containers
    * Scalable & cost-effective storage for binary files
* File Shares
    * Network file shares such as you typically find in corporate networks
* Tables 
    * Key-Value storage for applications that need to read and write data values quickly

Data engineers use Azure Storage to host data lakes - blob storage with a hierarchical namespace that enables files to be organised in a distributed file system

## Azure Data Factory
* A service that enables you to define and schedule data pipelines to transfer and transform data
* You can integrate your pipelines with other Azure services
* Enables you to ingest data from cloud data stores, process the data using cloud-based compute and persist the results in another data sotore

Data engineers use Azure Data Factory to build ETL solutions that populate analytical data stores with data from transactional systems

## Azure Synapse Analytics
* PaaS solution for a data analytics that provides a single service interface for the following analytical capabilities:
    * Pipelines
        * based on the same tech as Data Factory
    * SQL
        * highly scalable SQL DB engine optimised for data warehouse workloads
    * Apache Spark
        * open-source distributed data processing system
        * supports multiple programming languages and APIs including Python, Java, Scala & SQL
    * Azure Synapse Data Explorer
        * high performance data analytics solution 
        * optimised for real-time querying of log and telemetry data using Kusto Query Language

Data engineers can use Azure Synapse Analytics to create a unified data analytics solution that combines data ingestion pipelines, data warehouse storage, and data lake storage through a single service.

Data analysts can use SQL and Spark pools through interactive notebooks to explore and analyze data, and take advantage of integration with services such as Azure Machine Learning and Microsoft Power BI to create data models and extract insights from the data.

## Azure Databricks
* An Azure-integrated version of the popular Databricks platform
* Combines the Apache Spark data processing platform with SQL DB semantics and an integrated management interface
* Enables large-scale data analytics

Data engineers can use existing Databricks and Spark skills to create analytical data stores in Azure Databricks.

Data Analysts can use the native notebook support in Azure Databricks to query and visualize data in an easy to use web-based interface.

## Azure HDInsight
Provides Azure-hosted clusters for popular Apache open-source big data processing tech including:
* Apache Spark
    * A distributed data processing system that supports multiple programming languages and APIs incl. Python, Java, Scala & SQL
* Apache Hadoop
    * A distributed system that uses _MapReduce_ jobs to process large volumes of data efficiently across multiple cluster nodes
    * MapReduce jobs can be written in Java or abstracted by interfaces such as Apache Hive - a SQL-based API that runs on Hadoop
* Apache HBase
    * An open-source system for large-scale NoSQL data storage & querying
* Apache Kafka
    * A message broker for data stream processing

Data engineers can use Azure HDInsight to support big data analytics workloads that depend on multiple open-source technologies.

## Azure Stream Analytics
* A real-time stream processing engine that:
    1. captures a stream of data from an input
    2. applies a query to extract and manipulate that data
    3. writes the results to an output for analysis or further processing

Data engineers can incorporate Azure Stream Analytics into data analytics architectures that capture streaming data for ingestion into an analytical data store or for real-time visualisation.

## Azure Data Explorer
* A standalone service that offers the same high-performance querying of log and telemetry data as the Azure Synapse Data Explorer runtime in Azure Synapse Analytics

Data analysts can use Azure Data Explorer to query and analyze data that includes a timestamp attribute, such as is typically found in log files and Internet-of-things (IoT) telemetry data.

## Microsoft Purview
* A solution for enterprise-wide data governance and discoverability
* Can be used to create a map of your data and track data lineage across multiple data sources and systems
* Enables you to find trustworthy data for analysis and reporting

Data engineers can use Microsoft Purview to enforce data governance across the enterprise and ensure the integrity of data used to support analytical workloads.

## Microsoft Fabric
* A unified SaaS analytics platform base on open and governed lakehouse that including functionality to support:
    * Data ingestion & ETL
    * Data lakehouse analytics
    * Data warehouse analytics
    * Data Science and ML
    * Realtime analytics
    * Data visualisation
    * Data governance and management
