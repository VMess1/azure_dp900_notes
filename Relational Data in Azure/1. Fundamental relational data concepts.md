# Fundamental Relational Concepts

## Relational Data
* In a relational DB, you model collections of entities from the real world as tables.
* An entity can be anything for which you want to record information, typically important objects and events
    * E.g. a retail system might want tables for product, orders, customers and items
* A table contains rows with each row representing a single instance of an entity
* Relational tables are a format for structured data
* All rows will have the same columns, but some values may be recorded as NULL
* You can set the constraints of what data types of each column is e.g. Integer, Text, Date etc.


## Normalisation
The term used by DB professionals for a schema design process that minimises data duplication and enforces data integrity.

It is the process of reorganising data within a DB so that users can utilise it for further queries and analysis.

It eliminates redundant and unstructured data making the data appear similar across all records and fields

Data normalisation can be divided into different types of normal forms. The most common ones are 1NF, 2NF & 3NF.

#### 1NF - First Normal Form
The most basic form of data normalisation which ensures there are no two same entries in a group. For a table to be in the first normal form it should satisfy the following rules:
* Each cell should contain a single value (No lists, nested or complex data types)
* Each record should be unique 

#### 2NF - Second Normal form
In a 2NF table, all the subsets of data that can be placed in multiple rows are placed in seperate tables. For a table to be in the second normal form it should satisfy the following rules:
* It should be in 1F
* All non-key columns are dependent on the full primary key

#### 3NF - Third Normal form
In a 3NF table, each non-key column should depend on the primary key and nothing but the primary key. For a table to be in third normal form it should satisfy the following rules:
* It should be in 2F
* There are no transitive dependencies between columns


## SQL
* SQL is the standard language used to communicate with RDBMS. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update or retrieve data in a DB. 

* You can use SQL statements such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, and DROP to accomplish almost everything that you need to do in a DB. 

* Many DBMS also have their own additional proprietary extensions of SQL to handle the specifics of that DBMS

* These extensions provide functionality not covered by standard SQL such as security management and programmability

* Some popular dialects of SQL include:
    * Transact-SQL (T-SQL) 
        * This is used by Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Services
    * pgSQL 
        * Used in PostgreSQL
    * PL/SQL (Procedural Language)
        * Used by Oracle

### SQL Statement Types
Three main logical groups:
* Data Definition Language (DDL)
* Data Control Language (DCL)
* Data Manipulation Language (DML)

#### DDL Statements
Used to create, modify, and remove table and other objects in a DB

Most common statements are CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RENAME

#### DCL Statements
DB admins generally use DCL statements to manage access to objects in a DB by granting, denying, or revoking permissions

Three main statements - GRANT, DENY, REVOKE

#### DML Statements
Used to manipulate the rows in a table to retrieve data, insert & modify new rows and delete rows

Four main statements - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

## DB Objects
- Views
- Stored procedures
- Indexes
#### Views
* A virtual table based on the results of a SELECT query.
* Can think of it as a window on specified rows in one or more underlying tables to make it easy to view data

Example
~~~~
CREATE VIEW Deliveries
AS
SELECT o.OrderNo, o.OrderDate,
       c.FirstName, c.LastName, c.Address, c.City
FROM Order AS o JOIN Customer AS c
ON o.Customer = c.ID;
~~~~

#### Stored Procedures
* Defines SQL statements that can be run on command
* Used to encapsulate programmatic logic in a DB for actions that apps need to perform when working with data
* You can define a stored procedure with parameters to create a flexible solution for common actions that might need to be applied to data on a specific key or criteria

Example
~~~~ 
CREATE PROCEDURE RenameProduct
	@ProductID INT,
	@NewName VARCHAR(20)
AS
UPDATE Product
SET Name = @NewName
WHERE ID = @ProductID;
~~~~

To execute a stored procedure you would use:

~~~~ 
EXEC RenameProduct 201, 'Spanner';
~~~~

#### Indexes
* Helps search for data in a table
* When creating, you specify a column from the table, the index contains a copy of this data with pointers to the corresponding rows
* Indexes improve performance of queries on large data sets
* Indexes consume storage space and must be maintained if the data is manipulated
